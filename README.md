# veggies-with-nock

âœ¨ ðŸš€ Veggies is an awesome cucumberjs library for API/CLI testing. 
Great for testing APIs built upon Express, Koa, HAPI, Loopback and others. 
It's also the perfect companion for testing CLI applications built with commander, meow & Co.

This repository contains some examples of implementation veggies with nock. 
You can check the origin examples from [veggies repository](https://github.com/ekino/veggies)
